# Data-Drift-Detection-on-eBird-Data-
Welcome! This repository contains my experiments involving the application of various data drift methods to bird checklist data from eBird.
The code is primarily written in Jupyter Notebook. Enjoy exploring!

The data was collected from eBird, a citizen science platform where users report their bird checklists and counts. The experiments primarily focus on the data from the Jerusalem Observatory Station. Here are the relevant links:

- eBird official site: [https://ebird.org/home](https://ebird.org/home)
- Jerusalem Bird Observatory: [https://ebird.org/hotspot/L967976](https://ebird.org/hotspot/L967976)

Instructions for accessing the data: Please note that you will need to request permission from eBird to download the data. Visit [https://ebird.org/data/download](https://ebird.org/data/download) for more information on how to do so.
