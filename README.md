# Data-Drift-Detection-on-eBird-Data-
Welcome! This repository contains my experiments involving the application of various data drift methods to bird checklist data from eBird.
The code is primarily written in Jupyter Notebook. Enjoy exploring!

The data was collected from eBird, a citizen science platform where users report their bird checklists and counts. The experiments primarily focus on the data from the Jerusalem Observatory Station. Here are the relevant links:

- eBird official site: [https://ebird.org/home](https://ebird.org/home)
- Jerusalem Bird Observatory: [https://ebird.org/hotspot/L967976](https://ebird.org/hotspot/L967976)

Instructions for accessing the data: Please note that you will need to request permission from eBird to download the data. Visit [https://ebird.org/data/download](https://ebird.org/data/download) for more information on how to do so.

Contents: Drift Detection in Jerusalem Bird Observatory using a Machine Learning Approach

This GitHub repository contains a Jupyter Notebook where I conduct an experiment with the Lopez-Paz and Oquab (2017) method, a classifier-based drift detector. The notebook focuses on feature exploration and drift detection in Jerusalem bird observations.

Additionally, you will find another notebook titled "Jerusalem Birds Observation: Feature Exploration and Drift Detection with Two-Sample Tests." In this notebook, I perform two-sample tests, specifically the Smirnov-Kolmogorov and Cramer-Von-Mises tests, to analyze different bird species independently.

Feel free to explore and delve into the experiments conducted in this repository.
